# StudyFlow - Dynamic Study Progress Tracker

StudyFlow is a modern, interactive web application designed to help you organize, track, and conquer your learning goals. Built with a powerful tech stack including Next.js, TypeScript, and Google's Genkit, it provides a seamless and aesthetically pleasing experience for creating and managing your study plans.

## Key Features

*   **Full Manual Control**: Prefer to do it yourself? Create, edit, and organize your study plans with complete manual control. Add, reorder, and delete weeks, days, and individual tasks with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface (future feature) and simple editing tools.
*   **Multiple Creation Methods**: Whether you want to build one from scratch, or upload an existing plan from a JSON file, StudyFlow has you covered.
*   **Visual Progress Tracking**: Stay motivated with a clear overview of your progress. A main dashboard shows your completion percentage for all subjects, while each subject has its own detailed view with weekly and daily breakdowns.
*   **Integrated Task Timers**: Boost your focus with a Pomodoro-style timer built into every task. Set a duration, track your time spent, and watch the beautiful donut chart fill up as you work. Your time is automatically saved.
*   **Customizable Themes**: Make your dashboard your own! Choose a custom background color or upload your own image for each subject to easily distinguish between them, inspired by Google Keep. The UI features a clean, notebook-inspired aesthetic with frosted glass effects.
*   **Fully Responsive**: Study on the go! The application is designed to work beautifully on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Local Storage Persistence**: Your study plans and progress are automatically saved to your browser's local storage, so you can pick up right where you left off.
